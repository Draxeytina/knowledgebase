>Note
>> This is has been crafted according to specifications.
>> Future version will include analytics by topic searched.
>> The use of pg_search was a trade-off of producing quality results over quick results due to ranking. 
>> <a href="https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/stimulus-controller-dont-work-at-all-on-heroku-rails-7/81514">Heroku did not support the stimulus gem,</a> hence the live version will not load real-time. Improvements to be made.
