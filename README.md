>Note
>> This is has been crafted according to specifications.
>> Future version will include analytics by topic searched.
>> The use of pg_search was a trade-off of producing quality results over quick results due to ranking. 
>> Heroku did not support the stimulus gem, hence the live version will not load real-time. Improvements to be made.
